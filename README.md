# IWAC Spatial Overview — Transregional Islamic Connections Dashboard

The IWAC Spatial Overview is a public, exploratory dashboard designed to surface transregional Islamic connections across West Africa using historical newspaper articles. It builds on the Islam West Africa Collection (IWAC), an open‑access digital database directed and developed by Frédérick Madore and supported by the Leibniz‑Zentrum Moderner Orient (ZMO). IWAC relates to Islam and Muslims in Burkina Faso, Benin, Niger, Nigeria, Togo, and Côte d’Ivoire.

This dashboard helps researchers, students, journalists, and the wider public trace how people, ideas, institutions, and events circulate across borders and through time in West Africa’s Islamic landscapes.

## What you can do

- Explore maps to see where articles locate people, organizations, events, and subjects
- Compare countries and regions to spot cross‑border references and movement
- Follow changes over time with an interactive timeline and playback
- Drill into entities (persons, organizations, events, subjects) to view related places and articles
- Inspect emerging patterns and experimental networks of actors and locations

## Questions this can help answer

- When and where do specific Islamic actors or organizations appear across multiple countries?
- Which newspapers in Burkina Faso referenced events in Côte d’Ivoire, or vice‑versa?
- How do topics related to Islamic education, authority, or reform circulate spatially and temporally?
- What regions form recurring corridors of mention or influence across borders?

## How to use the dashboard

1) Choose a view from the sidebar (Overview, Map, Persons, Organizations, Events, Subjects, Networks).
2) Filter by country and time period; search or select an entity to drill down.
3) Use the map to pan/zoom and click regions to reveal details; the timeline shows change over time.
4) Combine filters to focus on specific crossings (e.g., Benin ↔ Togo references in a given decade).

Tip: The timeline’s play control lets you watch spatial patterns evolve across years.

## Data sources and scope

- Source: Islam West Africa Collection (IWAC), directed by Frédérick Madore (ZMO support).
- Content: Newspaper articles with curated metadata; locations are associated with articles and mapped to countries/regions.
- Coverage: The IWAC project encompasses Burkina Faso, Benin, Niger, Nigeria, Togo, and Côte d’Ivoire. The public dataset bundled with this repository currently highlights a subset and will expand over time.

### Method notes and limitations

- Newspaper metadata and entity extraction reflect ongoing curation and may contain OCR or cataloging inconsistencies.
- Place disambiguation and historical boundaries can affect how locations are mapped.
- Mentions in newspapers are proxies for activity and attention; corroborate with qualitative sources when interpreting patterns.

## Responsible use

Historical press sources can include sensitive or biased representations. Please interpret findings with care, consider historical context, and avoid over‑generalization from counts or map densities alone.
