# Network Visualization Enhancement Roadmap

## Overview
Current state: Dense network with 1427 nodes and 6084 edges making it difficult to extract meaningful insights.
Goal: Transform the visualization into an intuitive, interactive, and informative tool for exploring spatial relationships in IWAC data.

## Phase 1: Performance & Rendering Optimization (Week 1-2)

### 1.1 Implement Level-of-Detail (LOD) Rendering
- [ ] Add dynamic node/edge culling based on zoom level
- [ ] Implement viewport-based rendering (only render visible elements)
- [ ] Add WebGL renderer option for large networks (consider using deck.gl or sigma.js)
- [ ] Implement edge bundling for dense connections

### 1.2 Data Structure Optimization
- [ ] Implement quadtree/octree spatial indexing in `networkData.svelte.ts`
- [ ] Add lazy loading for node details
- [ ] Cache computed layouts
- [ ] Implement incremental layout updates

## Phase 2: Interactive Filtering & Search (Week 3-4)

### 2.1 Advanced Filtering System
- [ ] **Node Filtering**
  - Filter by node attributes (type, category, importance)
  - Degree centrality filter (show only highly connected nodes)
  - Community/cluster filter
  - Time-based filtering if temporal data exists
  
- [ ] **Edge Filtering**
  - Filter by edge weight/strength
  - Filter by edge type/category
  - Show only edges above threshold value
  - Directional edge filtering

### 2.2 Search & Highlight
- [ ] Implement fuzzy search for nodes
- [ ] Multi-select capability with Shift+Click
- [ ] Search history and saved searches
- [ ] Highlight paths between selected nodes

## Phase 3: Visual Clarity Improvements (Week 5-6)

### 3.1 Smart Layout Algorithms
- [ ] Implement multiple layout options:
  - Force-directed with adjustable parameters
  - Hierarchical layout for tree-like structures
  - Circular/radial layout for community visualization
  - Geographic layout if spatial coordinates exist
- [ ] Add layout transition animations
- [ ] Implement layout pinning for selected nodes

### 3.2 Visual Encoding Enhancements
- [ ] **Node Improvements**
  - Size mapping to importance metrics
  - Color coding by category/community
  - Shape variations for different node types
  - Icons/glyphs for semantic meaning
  - Halo effects for highlighted nodes
  
- [ ] **Edge Improvements**
  - Opacity based on weight/importance
  - Edge thickness mapping
  - Curved edges to reduce overlap
  - Animated edges for flow visualization
  - Edge color coding by type

## Phase 4: Clustering & Aggregation (Week 7-8)

### 4.1 Automatic Clustering
- [ ] Implement community detection algorithms (Louvain, Leiden)
- [ ] Hierarchical clustering with zoom-based expansion
- [ ] Meta-nodes representing clusters
- [ ] Smooth transitions between cluster levels

### 4.2 Manual Grouping
- [ ] Allow users to create custom groups
- [ ] Collapse/expand node groups
- [ ] Save and load grouping configurations
- [ ] Group-level operations (move, style, filter)

## Phase 5: Analysis Tools (Week 9-10)

### 5.1 Network Metrics Dashboard
- [ ] Calculate and display:
  - Degree centrality
  - Betweenness centrality
  - Closeness centrality
  - PageRank
  - Clustering coefficient
- [ ] Node-level metrics on hover/selection
- [ ] Network-level statistics panel

### 5.2 Path Analysis
- [ ] Shortest path finder between nodes
- [ ] All paths visualization
- [ ] Path length distribution
- [ ] Critical path identification

## Phase 6: User Interface Enhancements (Week 11-12)

### 6.1 Control Panel Improvements (`NetworkPanel.svelte`)
- [ ] Collapsible sections for different controls
- [ ] Preset configurations (saved views)
- [ ] Undo/redo functionality
- [ ] Export current view settings
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts guide

### 6.2 Information Display
- [ ] Rich tooltips with node/edge details
- [ ] Side panel for detailed information
- [ ] Comparison view for multiple selections
- [ ] Timeline slider if temporal data exists

## Phase 7: Export & Integration (Week 13-14)

### 7.1 Export Capabilities
- [ ] Export filtered network as:
  - SVG for high-quality graphics
  - PNG with customizable resolution
  - JSON/GraphML for further analysis
  - PDF for reports
- [ ] Export network statistics report
- [ ] Generate shareable links with current view

### 7.2 External Tool Integration
- [ ] Import/export Gephi compatible files
- [ ] Cytoscape.js format support
- [ ] Integration with Python network analysis (NetworkX)
- [ ] API for programmatic access
